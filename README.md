# Automati_HTML_CODE_Generator
   AUTOMATIC-HTML-CODE-GENERATOR Automatic HTML Code Generator can generate the markup language(HTML). In this deep learning project, we used the architecture of pixtocode by Tony Beltramelli, one of the famous papers released back in 2017 which bring a revolution on code generation. In this project handmade wireframes are used and tokenization is done for the tags of HTML, like image captioning the images of wireframes are pass to CNN than the respective HTML code is pass to the lstm and concatenation is done and they are fed to the lstm and training is done then we generate the code by uploading the wireframe
